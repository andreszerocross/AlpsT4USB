# AlpsT4USB

This is a satellite kext which uses VoodooI2C's multitouch engine to bring native multitouch to the Alps
T4 USB touchpad found on the Elite X2 1012 G1 and G2 devices.

# Installation Considerations

Currently this kext only works when installed to /Library/Extensions.  VoodooI2C and VoodooI2CHID must 
also be installed to /Library/Extensions.
